# Please allow me to write in English
 - I realized that Zayyar worte his in Myanamr but I would like to speciallly write mine in english cos I want the person who is reading this to get a more understanding of importance of english during job search and get a better famililarity with the terms and words.
 - The below are my sharing on Job search

# Things I think what really helped me
 1. **Change the resume based on the JD of the position.**
     - For the first two months of my job search, I followed the rule of MIU to use the same resume for every job I applied. Let me tell you, it gave me no good result. I don't know about others but for me, I didn't even get a screening call weekly. So I started changing my resume and that's when things picked up.
     - No need to change the resume for every job that you applied, although it's good if you could do that.
     - BUT for the jobs that you really want/like/feel-the-high-potential, please change your resume slightly according to the job description of the position.
     - Make sure your resume have the main skills they are looking for and if possible, alter your projects a little bit to reflect those skills.
 2. **Prepare different resume for differnt positions.**
    - For me, I was searching for Frontend and Fullstack positions and in Front-end, there were angular positions and react positions.
    - So I have 3 differents resumes and cover letters. 
      1. Frontend Angular
      2. Frontend React
      3. Fullstack
    - Then I submitted the resume based on the positions I applied. But I focused more on Frontend.
    - (Pls conact me or Zayyar for password of the resume zip file)
  3. **Watch many interview videos on Youtube!** They are where we can observe other people doing interviews and get Interview sense for free!
     - Watching interview videos on Youtube really helped me experience how the IT interviews are done in US market.
     - Interview experiences and the technical terms are what I was mostly lacking.
     - My first two interviews, I didn't really know what to expect or how to prepare correctly, so I made a lot mistakes, couldn't answer what they were looking for,.. etc.
     - Search them up according to the position you are applying for. Mock-Interview videos are also very helpful.
     - You can learn the typical interview questions, some surprise questions you didn't know before and the accent of interviewers (mostly indians).
     - You will also learn the technical terms and observe how other people answer, so it really help the way you prepare and do in your actual interviews.
  4. **Workplace practices and workflow process**
     - in US, almost all companies use Scrum and Agile. So it'd be great if you have knowledage about sprints, issues, story etc. If not, please learn about it just to know what they are.
     - Also please refer to No.5 and No.6 below.
     - It doesn't matter if you really have these experiences or not. Make it sound like you do and that's what I did.
  5. **TESTING and Code Coverage**
     - I came to realize after 2 months of job search that Testing is as much important as Developing.
     - You NEED to know the testing frameworks of your language and how to run the tests after you did the developing.
     - "Code Coverage" is the terms they used a lot and it means the % of successulf test result after runing the tests.
     - Based on code coverage, they will approve/reject your codes/pull request.
  6. **Git is a necessary skill!**
      - We need to know what the follwings are (even if you don't really know how to actually do them)
        1. repo, add, commit, checkout, push, pull, clone etc
        2. what is branch, local branch, remote branch
        3. what is pull request (PR), merge, 360 degree review
        4. how to resolve the code conflict
  7. **My Experince on workflow question**
      - In the 2nd round of my frist interview, I was asked to decribe how I do my work in my previous company. I answered with the OS, IDE, Databases and languages I used. But I guess that was not what they wanted because I could feel the interviewer became less enthusiastic after that question and didn't pass the round.
      - After that, my go-to answer for this type of question is
        > In my previous company, we normallly do 2-week sprint and used Jira to manage the stories and issues. Usually, I took initiative and assigned myself to the stories to work on and checkouted a branch for it. After working on it and covered the required code coverage which is 79%, I then committed and pushed to the main repo and raised a PR. After the PR was approved, it then merged into main branch and continued to CICD pipeline.  
      - (pls realize here, I tried to use "sprint", "Jira", "checkout branch", "commit, push", "code coverage", "raise PR", "merge to main".  I wanted to show that I got experience and know the drill. I got good responses with this answer.)
  8. **English and Good story teller!**
     - Most important of all is TRY TO BE A GOOD SPEAKER in English.
     - I'm not trying to discriminate but some recruiters really drop you if you can't speak well when they do the screening call. (Some even look down on you and I hate those guys)
     - Another important skills - BE CONFIDENT AND BE A GOOD STORY TELLER! 
     - let me repeat again - **It doesn't matter if you really have these experiences or not. Make it sound like you do.** They can't check those tiny details of our past experience.
     - What really matters is we MUST make them believe that we got the skills and experience to easily integrated into the new job.

  # Other Things 
  1. **Apply - Practice, Apply - Practice**
     - Personally for me, it's been quite a while since I try looking for a job, so there were many things I need to know and learn. So I spent the half of my days to apply for jobs and half to learn the required skills.
     - People say "When you are jobless, searhing for a job is your job" and it's absolutely true. But I think brushing up our skills and trying to be ready for any upcoming interviews is just as important. Otherwise, the hard-earned interviews won't get fruitful.
     - I tried the coding certificates from HackerRank. I think they are very good for the resume and LinkedIn profile, plus I get to know my compentency myself. 
     -  For frontend developers, not only algorithms but also CSS, SCSS and HTML are asked in the coding round. (eg. create hamburger menu, calculater app, image carousel etc)
     -  Here are a few resourses I used during my job search
        - HackerRank - prepare : [https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
        - HackerRank - Certify : [https://www.hackerrank.com/skills-verification](https://www.hackerrank.com/skills-verification)
        - Neetcode : [https://neetcode.io/practice](https://neetcode.io/practice)
        - FrontEnd Questions : [https://bigfrontend.dev/problem](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem)
        - Frontend Pactices similiar to code test : [https://frontendeval.com/](https://frontendeval.com/)
        - LinkedIn assessment quizz Answers 😎 :  [https://github.com/Ebazhanov/linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/](https://github.com/Ebazhanov/linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/)  
> About Hackerrank, I got Javascript(Basic, Intermidate), React(Basic) and Angular(Basic).  <br>I posted those in my LinkedIn profile as well and not sure if it's a coincidence or not, I got my BOA interview a short while after my angular certificate and I didn't get asked too much in my interviews like before. It's like they already knew I could do it so just asked some easy questions to confirm my skills. <br> OR.. it may because, by that time, I'm pretty much skillful in Angular interview after all the practices and tests I did, so I found the interview quite easy. 
<br>Anyway, I encourage anyone to try Hackerrank Certificates if you could.
<br>For anyone who is trying Frontend positions, I had shared my collection of notes in my resume zip file.

  2. **Behavior Questions**
     - Behavior Questions always come even in the online tests I had to take from the links given.
     - I was asked to record a video of me answering those questions and was given one minute to prepare. Some companies allow to re-take the videos and some won't allow.
     - When faced a situation like this, it's really helpful if you are a good story teller as I said above 😅
     - I think we should prepare about 3 projects and at least 7 scenarios for behavior quesitions following STAR format.
     - I have a very good excel sheet given by Amazon to prepare for thier interviews but it is based on their leadership principles. Still, it's a very good way to preapre for the behaviour questions. Focus on 'Resume De-construction' tab. It is in my resume zip file. (Pls conact me or Zayyar for password)
  3. **Be Patient and your time will come**
     - According to my personal experience during the job search, sometimes I felt very down, sometimes I felt hopeful and sometime I felt like giving up.
     - I think that's what everyone who trying to find a job feels and the more time it takes, the worst it gets. We are just being our adult selves and deal with it in our own ways.
     - I kept to myselft and didn't tell anyone but I think I had some level of depression in past 3 months, although I tried my best to stay positive. My way of dealing is talking to the family and learning & practicing everything I think I should or I want to. Cooking, taking a walk and going out once in a while also helps.
     - So if you are feeling down during your job search, please remember you are here because you got what it takes to be here and you have done it till now so YOU CAN DO IT whatever it may come.
     - The timeframe of job search is vary depending on individuals but that's normal.
     - Just try your hardest in everything you can because HARDWORK ALWAYS PAYS OFF and your time will surely come 🤗 
       <br>
# Good luck to all of us 🍀💙
