# Please allow me to write in English
 - I realized that Zayyar worte his in Myanamr but I would like to speciallly write mine in english cos I want the person who is reading this to get a more understanding of importance of english during job search and get a better famililarity with the terms and words.
 - The below are my sharing on Job search and our mentel health.

# Things I think what really helped me
 1. Change the resume based on the JD of the position.
     - No need to change the resume for every job that you applied, although it's good if you could do that.
     - BUT for the jobs that you really want/like/feel-the-high-potential, please change your resume slightly according to the job description of the postion.
     - Make sure your resume have the main skills they are looking for and if possible, alter your projects a little bit to reflect those skills.
     - (optional) Remove the projects or responsiblies that are not related (or) do not reflect the required skills so that they won't confuse the recruiters or anyone who would read the resume.
 2. Prepare different resume for differnt positons.
    - For me, I was searching for Frontend and Fullstack positions and in Front-end, there were angular positions and react positions.
    - So I have 3 differents resumes and cover letters. 
      1. Frontend Angular
      2. Frontend React
      3. Fullstack
    - Then I submitted the resume based on the positions I applied. But I focused more on Frontend.
  3. Watch many interview videos on Youtube! They are where you can observe other people doing interviews and get Interview sense for free!
     - Search them up according to the position you are appling for. Mock-Interview videos are also very helpful.
     - Interview experiences and the technical terms are what I was mostly lacking!! I think most of us are.
     - My first two interviews, I didn't really know what to expect or how to preparely correctly, so I made a lot mistakes, couldn't answer what they were looking for,.. etc.
     - Watching interview videos on Youtube really helped me experience how the IT interviews are done in US market.
     - You can learn the typical interview questions, some surprise questions you didn't know before and the accent of interviewers (mostly indians).
     - You will also learn the technical terms and observe how other people answer, so it really help the way you prepare and do in your actual interviews.
  4. Your previous projects and workflow process.
     - in US, almost all companies use Scrum and Agile. So it'd be great if you have knowledage about it like sprints, issues, story etc. If not, please learn about it.
     - Also please refer to No.5 and No.6 below.
     - It doesn't matter if you really have these experiences or not. Make it sound like you do and that's what I did.
  5. TESTING and Code Coverage!
     - I came to realize after 2 months of job search that Testing is as much important as Developing.
     - You NEED to know the testing frameworks of your language and how to run the tests after you did the developing.
     - "Code Coverage" is the terms they used a lot and it means the % of successulf test result after runing the tests.
     - Based on code coverage, they will approve/reject your codes/pull request.
  6. Git is a necessary skill!
      - You need to at least know the following
        1. basic terms : repo, add, commit, checkout, push, pull, clone etc
        2. what is branch, local branch, remote branch
        3. what is pull request (PR), merge, 360 degree review
        4. how to resolve the code conflict
  7. My Experince on workflow question
      - In the 2nd round of my frist interview, I was asked to decribe how I do my work in my previous company. I answered with the OS, IDE, Databases and languages I used. But I guess that was not what they wanted to hear because I could feel the interviewer became less enthusiastic after that question and didn't pass that round.
      - After that, my go-to answer for that type of question is
        > In my previous company, we normallly do 2-week sprint and used Jira to manage the stories and issues. Usually, I took initiative and assigned myselft to the stories to work on and checkouted a branch for it. After working on it and covered the required code coverage which is 79%, I then committed and pushed to the main repo and raised a PR. After the PR was approved, it then merged into main branch and continued to CICD pipeline.  
      - (pls realize here, I tried to use "sprint", "Jira", "checkout branch", "commit, push", "code coverage", "raise PR", "merge to main".  I wanted to show that I got experience, I know the drill. And got good responses with this answer.)
      - You could refer to my answer if you don't have your own.
  8. English and Good story teller!
     - Most important of all is TRY TO BE A GOOD SPEAKER in English.
     - I'm not trying to discriminate but some recruiters really drop you if you can't speak well when they do the screening call.
     - (Some even look down on you and I hate those guys)
     - Another important skills - BE A GOOD STORY TELLER! 
     - let me repeat again - It doesn't matter if you really have these experiences or not. Make it sound like you do.
     - They can't check those tiny details of your past experience.
     - What really matters is we MUST showcase we got the skills and know the usual workflow/process in US! So, you are the guy they looking and you can get easily integrated into this new job.
